# Welcome to Brain Organoids Diffusion Project[BODP]

Thank you for accessing the "read me" file for the Brain Organoid Difussion Project(BODP) on GitHub! We appreciate your interest and would like to provide some essential information to help you navigate this project effectively.

## Project Overview

BODP consists of the development of brain organoids. Three-dimensional in vitro models of the human brain rely heavily on the intricate diffusion process through the organoid membrane. The membrane is a crucial interface between the organoid and its surrounding culture medium, controlling the transport of essential substances necessary for proper organoid development. Diffusion, the passive movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to low concentration, plays a vital role in facilitating the exchange of nutrients, gases, and signaling molecules across the membrane. The efficiency of diffusion greatly impacts brain organoid development. Proper maintenance of these factors ensures the organoid receives the necessary resources for cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation. The diffusion gradient becomes more pronounced due to the increasing distance between the outer surface and the internal regions. This gradient affects the distribution of nutrients and signaling molecules within the organoid, emphasizing the importance of efficient cellular development throughout the structure. Researchers can enhance nutrient delivery, waste removal, and overall organoid functionality by understanding and optimizing diffusion mechanisms. This leads to a more accurate representation of brain development and neurological disorders in vitro. The project is built using Matlab, Python, C, and G-Code, and it utilizes hardware to assemble the whole operation.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/braingeneersdifussionproject.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd braingeneersdifussionproject`
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` (depending on the project)

## Usage

BODP provides the following features and functionality:

1. If you want to visualize the pH gas control module, please go to the 'Arduino' folder containing the script designed for this purpose. 
2. For imaging processing, we provide the '.m' scripts written in MATLAB for video segmentation and absorbance quantification. 
3. To review the 3D printed parts for this project, please look at the folder 'Print_Files.' You can download them here; a description is provided in the supplementary material, Table 4.
4. The 'Pyhton' folder contains the scripts to control the environmental sensor in micropython and the main directory to control the programmable TECAN pump.
5. The 'Raw Data' folder contains the images and the videos for the fluorescence image capture and the CFD simulation.   

To start using the project, follow these steps:

1. Please refer to: Torres-Montoya et al. (2024). An Integrated Platform for Real-time Monitoring and Support of 3D Tissue Growth.
